# Linux Scripts

This repository will hold various scripts written for linux systems, which will use bash or similar. For example, the FPS script included here uses ksh93, however, the scripting itself is almost identical to bash. The main difference for the FPS script being how numbers are processed.

## Organization

This repository does not have a set organizational scheme yet. As I build more scripts, the organization will develop and become standardized. Expect changes!
