# Linux Scripts

This repository will hold various scripts written for linux systems, which will use bash, or similar. For example, the FPS script, included here, uses ksh93. However, the scripting language itself is almost identical to bash. The main difference, for the FPS script, is how numbers are processed. Using ksh93 allows for simple and easy floating point number calculations, which is advantageous when using subsecond precision in the time variables.

## Organization

This repository does not have a set organizational scheme yet. As I build more scripts, the organization will develop and become standardized. Expect changes!
